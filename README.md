# Cracker
A hash cracker so simple, a five year old can use it.
Wraps hashcat, and identifies hash type automatically.

# Installation
Requires the smaller crackstation_human_only wordlist (too big to include) from [here](https://crackstation.net/crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm).  
Copy it to this directory and you are good to go.  

# Usage
python3 cracker.py HASH
